This archive contains dataset of image pairs with manually annotated ground truth in form of corresponding points homogeneous coordinates (6Ã—N, usually ~10 points, A image coordinates first) in Matlab structures (validation.pts). The naming convention is as follows: first image nameA.ext, second image nameB.ext, validation points name_vpts.mat. For some pairs there may be additional information in the validation structure.
